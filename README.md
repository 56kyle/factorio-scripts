# Overview
Most of these scripts are designed for use in sandbox mode. Because of this, 
they generally won't reference any external packages so that the script can easily be copy pasted
into the Lua Snippets execution tab.

Additionally, there are a couple utility command line scripts to copy these scripts into your local
snippets all at once.
